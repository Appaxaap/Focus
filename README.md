## 🌟 Why Focus Exists

Most productivity apps **add complexity** — with logins, cloud sync, ads, and notifications that fragment your attention.

**Focus is different**:
- 🌙 **Truly offline** — no internet required  
- 🔒 **Zero tracking** — your data never leaves your device  
- 🧘 **Designed for calm** — minimal UI, maximum clarity  
- 💙 **Free forever** — no paywalls, ever  

> Built for people who value **privacy, intention, and deep work**.

---

## 🧠 The Eisenhower Matrix, Simplified

Focus implements Dwight Eisenhower’s timeless prioritization framework:

|                          | **Important**               | **Not Important**         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Urgent**               | ✅ **Do First**             | 🤝 **Delegate**           |
| **Not Urgent**           | 📅 **Schedule**             | 🗑️ **Eliminate**          |

Visually organize tasks into these quadrants to **cut through noise** and focus on what moves the needle.

## 🔍 How Focus Stands Out

| Feature                | Focus                          | Typical Task Apps         |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Privacy**       | ✅ 100% local (Hive)           | ❌ Cloud-synced           |
| **Offline Access**     | ✅ Always                      | ❌ Requires internet      |
| **Cost**               | ✅ Free forever                | ❌ Freemium/paywalls      |
| **Complexity**         | ✅ Minimalist                  | ❌ Feature overload       |
| **Notifications**      | ✅ Only for your tasks         | ❌ Marketing/promotions   |

## 🎯 For Whom?

- 🧠 **Deep work practitioners**  
- 🎨 **Creators & makers**  
- 📚 **Students & researchers**  
- 🧘 **Minimalists** who value intentionality  

> If you believe **productivity ≠ busyness**, this is your app.
